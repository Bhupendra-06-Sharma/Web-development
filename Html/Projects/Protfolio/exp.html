    <center><big style="color: aliceblue;"><pre>"My expression lies at the intersection of Logic and Creativity. 
        As an AI/ML student, I view content through a structural lens—understanding patterns, 
        hooks, and algorithms. As a creator, I use that data to fuel human emotion. 
        I believe that the future of storytelling isn't just about pretty visuals; 
        it's about using technology to deliver the right message to the right audience at the perfect time."</pre></big></center>
